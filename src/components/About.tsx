              Hello! I'm John, a software engineer passionate about creating software that makes a difference. My journey in coding started back in 2015 when I decided to try customizing a WordPress theme â€” turns out hacking together a custom theme taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, and a large corporation. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences for a variety of clients.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science while working as a Full-Stack Developer at TechCorp, where I'm applying my knowledge to solve real-world problems with elegant solutions.

              When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually rock climbing, hiking, or exploring new coffee shops in the city.
